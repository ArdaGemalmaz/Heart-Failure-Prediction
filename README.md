# Heart-Failure-Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the biggest dangers to human life. As observed, approximately 17.9 million
people are dying from cardiovascular diseases. Some people which have cardiovascular risk or disease need
to be detected before it is too late. This project will be a great help for that. The goal of this project is to
predict heart disease on sample data and make a classification to identify which category belongs to based
on a training set while we are doing observations on the dataset. The dataset that we are using contains 13
clinical features that we will use to predict the death rate.
